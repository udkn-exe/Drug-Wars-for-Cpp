### About
A faithful C++ recreation of "Drug Wars", the iconic turn-based strategy game for IBM compatibles, originally created in BASIC by John E. Dell in 1984. Built based on the TI-82 version, a widely popular port for the TI graphing calculator range written by Jonathan Maier in 1993 in TI-Basic, its built-in interpreted BASIC-like language, which uses syntax comprised of specialized characters and mathematical symbols available on the calculator - which became a rapidly popular shareware throughout high schools in the 90s and 2000s using the calculator's "TI Connect" file transfer functionality.
